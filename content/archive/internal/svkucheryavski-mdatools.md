This is a user guide for mdatools â€” R package for preprocessing, exploring and analysis of multivariate data. The package provides methods mostly common for Chemometrics. The general idea of the package is to collect most of the common chemometric methods and give a similar user interface for using them. So if a user knows how to make a model and visualise results for one method, he or she can easily do this for the others.
