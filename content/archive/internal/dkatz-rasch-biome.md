This book is meant to be used as a guide for getting started using the Rasch model [...] This is meant to be a general introduction to using the Rasch model for constructing measures in R. The book is meant to get you started but is by no means where you should stop. Please see, Wilson (2005) and Bond and Fox (2015) for more. To get started, move to the next chapter. For an extremely brief overview, read below. The Rasch model is based on a theory of measurement. Whereas one may typically fine-tune a model to fit the data, in the Rasch paradigm, one compares the data to the Rasch model. Under  ...
