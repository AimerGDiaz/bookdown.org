This is a minimal example of using the bookdown package to write a book. The output format for this example is bookdown::gitbook. [...] This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocâ€™s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need pdfLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/ti ...
