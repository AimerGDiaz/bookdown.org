This book provides an introduction to data science that is tailored to the needs of psychologists, but is also suitable for students of the humanities and other biological or social sciences. This audience typically has some elementary knowledge of statistics, but rarely an idea how the data got into a shape that allows for statistical testing. By using various data types and working with many different examples, we teach tools for transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data. By keeping our eyes open for the perils and pitfalls of misleading representations, the book fosters fundamental skills of data literacy and cultivates reproducible research practices that enable and precede any practical use of statistics. The corresponding course provides and introduction to data science and teaches R from a tidyverse perspective. Individual sessions summarize and elaborate upon essential parts of the ‘R for Data Science’ textbook. Many practical examples and exercises should appeal to the interests of social scientists who aim to apply the newly aquired tools to challenging problems. Hopefully, students will find solving these exercises both instructive and enjoyable and the summaries of essential commands helpful.
