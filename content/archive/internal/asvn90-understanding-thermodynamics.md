Understanding Thermodynamics: Course Notes [...] Thermodynamics is the study of energy and energy conversion. For example, in a coal fired power station, during the combustion of coal, the energy in the coal is released as heat that is used to convert high pressure liquid water into high pressure steam. In a turbine the energy in the steam is converted into mechanical energy which turns the shaft of the turbine in order to generate electric energy in the generator. Often this electric energy is again converted into heat in the stove plate of an electric stove or the heating element of a ...
