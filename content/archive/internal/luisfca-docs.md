This book was written for undergraduate level students on Quantitative Methods at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). The primary goal of this book is to provide a short and to-the-point exposition on the essentials of statistics. To a lesser degree, the mathematical modeling of statistical questions will be addressed. I expect this book can also help students who enroll for laboratory-based statistics and anyone who wants to learn R.
