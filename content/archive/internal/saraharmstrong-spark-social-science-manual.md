Spark Social Science Manual [...] Let the sample mean, \(\hat{\mu}\), be the parameter estimate for our mean parameter \(\mu\) and the null hypothesis of the t-test be \(H_0\): \(/mu = 0\). The test statistic is given by \(\hat{\mu} / (\hat{\sigma} / \sqrt{n})\). Remember that the p-value is determined by the test statistic and the t-distribution with \((n â€“ 2)\) degrees of freedom in this case. By the Central Limit Theorem, \(\sqrt{n}*(\hat{\mu}-\mu) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2)\) as \(n \rightarrow \infty\), or written differently as \(\hat{\mu} \rightarrow \mu + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}N(0,1)\) ...
