This textbook presents a simulation-based approach to probability, using the Symbulate package. [...] Why study probability? Why use simulation to study probability? This book uses the Python package Symbulate (https://github.com/dlsun/symbulate) which provides a user friendly framework for conducting simulations involving probability models. The syntax of Symbulate reflects the “language of probability” and makes it intuitive to specify, run, analyze, and visualize the results of a simulation. In Symbulate, probability spaces, events, random variables, and random processes are symbolic ...
