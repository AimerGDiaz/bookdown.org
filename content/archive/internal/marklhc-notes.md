Handout for the workshop ‘Advancing Quantitative Science with Monte Carlo Simulations’. [...] We know that, based on the CLT, under very general regularity conditions, when
sample size is large, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will follow a
normal distribution, with mean equals to the population mean, \(\mu\), and standard
deviation (which is called the standard error in this case) equals the
population SD divided by the square root of the fixed sample size. Let \(\bar X\) be
the sample mean, then \[\bar X \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{N}\right)\] Let’s imagine a ...
