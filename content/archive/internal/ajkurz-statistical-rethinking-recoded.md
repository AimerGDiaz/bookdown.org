It’s the entry-level textbook for applied researchers I spent a couple years looking for. McElreath’s freely-available lectures on the book are really great, too. However, I’ve come to prefer using Bürkner’s brms package when doing Bayeisn regression in R. It’s just spectacular. I also prefer plotting with Wickham’s ggplot2, ...
