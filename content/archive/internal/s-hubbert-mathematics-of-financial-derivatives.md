Chapter 4 Arbirtrage Free Derivative Pricing | Mathematics of Financial Derivatives. [...] Let us recall the model that we have proposed for the evolution of our asset. We wrote that over a time interval \([t,t+\delta t]\) the asset price moves according to:
\[
S_{t+\delta t}= S_{t}+S_{t}\mu\delta t +S_{t}\sigma\sqrt{\delta t}Z_{t}
\]
or, equivalently, we have
\[
\frac{S_{t+\delta t}-S_{t}}{S_{t}}=\mu\delta t+ \sigma\sqrt{\delta t}Z_{t}.
\]
The numerator of the right hand side is just the corresponding change in the asset price over the time interval \(\delta t,\) we can denote this as ...
