Chapter 4 Arbirtrage Free Derivative Pricing | Mathematics of Financial Derivatives. [...] Let us recall the model that we have proposed for the evolution of our asset. We wrote that over a time interval \([t,t+\delta t]\) the asset price moves according to: or, equivalently, we have The numerator of the right hand side is just the corresponding change in the asset price over the time interval \(\delta t,\) we can denote this as \(\delta S\) and write We note that our incremental model (4.1) explicitly features an increment of Brownian motion and we write it as In the differential limit as ...
