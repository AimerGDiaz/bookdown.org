This book provides a comprehensive overview of implementing circular visualization in R by cirlize package, espeically focusing on visualizaing high dimentional genomic data and revealing complex relationships by Chord diagram. [...] This is the documentation of the circlize package. Examples in the book are generated under version 0.4.2. If you use circlize in your publications, I would be appreciated if you can cite: Gu, Z. (2014) circlize implements and enhances circular visualization in R. Bioinformatics.
