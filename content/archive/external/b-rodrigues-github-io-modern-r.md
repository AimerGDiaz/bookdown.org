This book will teach you how to use R to solve you statistical, data science and machine learning problems. Importing data, computing descriptive statistics, running regressions (or more complex machine learning models) and generating reports are some of the topics covered. No previous experience with R is needed. [...] This book is still being written. Chapters 1 to 8 are almost ready, but more content is being added
(especially to chapter 8). 9 and 10 are empty for now. Some exercises might be at the wrong place
too and more are coming. If you already like what you read, you can support
me ...
