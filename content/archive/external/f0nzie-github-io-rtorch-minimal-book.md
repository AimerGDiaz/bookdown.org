This is a minimal tutorial of using the rTorch package to have fun while doing machine learning. This book was produced with bookdown. [...] You need two things to get rTorch working: Install Python Anaconda. Preferrably, for 64-bits, and above Python 3.6+. Install R, Rtools and RStudio. Install rTorch from CRAN or GitHub. Note. It is not mandatory to have a previously created Python environment with Anaconda, where PyTorch and TorchVision have already been installed. This step is optional. You could also get it installed directly from the R console, in very similar fashion as in R-TensorFlow  ...
