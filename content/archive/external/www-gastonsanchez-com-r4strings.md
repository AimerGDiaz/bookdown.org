This book aims to provide a panoramic perspective of the wide array of string manipulations that you can perform with R. If you are new to R, or lack experience working with character data, this book will help you get started with the basics of handling strings. Likewise, if you are already familiar with R, you will find material that shows you how to do more advanced string and text processing operations.
