The focus of this document is on common data processing and exploration techniques in R, especially as a prelude to visualization. The first part of the document will cover data structures, the dplyr and tidyverse packages, which enhance and facilitate the sorts of operations that typically arise when dealing with data, including faster I/O and grouped operations. For visualization, the focus will be on using ggplot2 and other packages that allow for interactivity. In addition, basic programming concepts and techniques are introduced. Exercises may be found in the document as well. In addition, the demonstrations of the data processing section are available in Python via Jupyter notebooks.
