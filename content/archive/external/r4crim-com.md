These notes introduce the programming language R and are meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and turning it into useful information such as cleaning the data, graphing it, or running statistical tests on the data. While R is a useful tool for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data for the example data sets.
