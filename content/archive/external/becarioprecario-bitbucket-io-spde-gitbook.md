Advanced Spatial Modeling with Stochastic Partial Differential Equations Using R and INLA [...] This book grew out of a tutorial written by Elias T. Krainski, which he
started in 2013 together with his PhD-studies at NTNU, Trondheim,
Norway. The tutorial has since then been expanded continuously, based
on response from the many users and based on new developments. Lindgren, Rue, and Lindström (2011) describe an approximation to continuous spatial
models with a Matérn covariance that is based on the solution to a
stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). This approximation is
computed ...
