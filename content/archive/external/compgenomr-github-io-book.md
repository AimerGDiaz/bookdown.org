A guide to computationa genomics using R. The book covers fundemental topics with practical examples for an interdisciplinery audience [...] The aim of this book is to provide the fundamentals for data analysis for genomics. We developed this book based on the computational genomics courses we are giving every year. We have had invariably an interdisicplinary audience with backgrounds from physics, biology, medicine, math, computer science or other quantitative fields. We want this book to be a starting point for computational genomics students and a guide for further data analysis in more ...
