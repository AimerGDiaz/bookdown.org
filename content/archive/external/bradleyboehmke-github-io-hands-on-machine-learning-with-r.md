A Machine Learning Algorithmic Deep Dive Using R. [...] Welcome to Hands-on Machine Learning with R. This book provides hands-on modules for many of the most common machine learning methods to include: You will learn how to build and tune these various models with R packages that have been tested and approved due to their ability to scale well. However, my motivation in almost every case is to describe the techniques in a way that helps develop intuition for its strengths and weaknesses. For the most part, I minimize mathematical complexity when possible but also provide resources to get ...
