Getting Started
=================================

## Install {.bigNumber .color1}

First install the R package **bookdown** as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')
```

Note that it's important to install **devtools** first to ensure you are running a recent version of it (>= 1.10).

Next, install the latest [Preview Release](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) of RStudio IDE (this release is required for the build and preview features described below).


## Edit {.bigNumber .color2}

The best way to get started is to fork or clone the the repository <https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo> (if you aren't familiar with Git and GitHub you can alternatively you can download it as a [zip file](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo/archive/master.zip)).

After you have the demo book, you should open it as a project within RStudio, open the `index.Rmd` file and click the **Knit** button:

Now you should see the index page of this book demo in the preview window:

Kniting the `index.Rmd` file will build all of the chapters of the book using the default output format. Kniting other chapters (e.g. `01-intro.Rmd`) will build and preview just that chapter.

You may add or change the R Markdown files and hit the **Knit** button again to preview the book or individual chapters. If you prefer not to use RStudio, you may also compile the book through command line as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")
```

To build all chapters and all formats of the book you can use the **Build Book** button within the RStudio Build pane:

By default the HTML, PDF, and ePub formats of the book will be compiled into the `_book` sub-directory of the project (you can also build a single format at a time using the Build Book menu).

For the comprehensive documentation of **bookdown**, please see <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown>.

## Publish {.bigNumber .color2}

To publish your books to bookdown.org, you need to first create an account by [signing in](/connect/) with your Google account, and then call the function `publish_book()` in R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::publish_book(render = 'local')
```

If it is the first time you have tried to publish the book, you will be asked to authorize **bookdown** to publish to your bookdown.org account.
